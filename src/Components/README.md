# Blazor

**Build modern, interactive web-based UIs with C# and Razor.**

This folder contains the underlying *components* programming model that powers both server-side and client-side [Blazor](#blazor) applications.

Blazor is a component based web UI framework. Blazor apps can run client-side in browser on WebAssembly or server-side as part of an ASP.NET Core app. Blazor is a full single-page application (SPA) framework inspired by the latest JavaScript SPA frameworks, featuring support for offline/PWA applications, app size trimming, and browser-based debugging.

Blazor uses only the latest web standards. No plugins or transpilation needed. It runs in the browser on a real .NET runtime implemented in [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org) that executes normal .NET assemblies.
