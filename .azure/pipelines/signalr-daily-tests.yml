# Daily Tests for ASP.NET Core SignalR
# These use Sauce Labs resources, hence they run daily rather than per-commit.

# The only Daily Tests we have run in Sauce Labs and only need to run on one machine (because they just trigger SauceLabs)
# Hence we use the 'default-build.yml' template because it represents a single phase
